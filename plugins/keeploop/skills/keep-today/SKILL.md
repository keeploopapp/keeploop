Use the Keeploop tools from whichever Keeploop connector this chat has: the Keeploop extension in the Claude app on my Mac, or Keeploop Remote on the web and phone. If both are there, use the extension. Their names may carry a prefix; use them by their Keeploop name. If no Keeploop connector is available, tell me to turn on the Keeploop extension or Keeploop Remote, and stop.

Show me my day, using the Keeploop tools.

1. Call list_events with start and end both set to today's date (YYYY-MM-DD) to get today's events.
2. Call awaiting_reply with direction="me" and days=2 to find threads waiting on me.
3. Call list_monitors, then check_monitor with limit=100 for each active monitor. Hits come oldest first: while a call returns 100 hits, call it again with since_hit_id set to the last_hit_id it returned. Keep the hits from today.
Then write three short sections. Schedule: each event's time, title and location, oldest first; mark events that are over, and flag overlaps or back-to-back meetings. Replies owed: sender, subject and mail_id, most urgent first, at most five. Monitor hits: the monitor's name and what arrived. Leave out a section that is empty and say "Nothing on today" if all three are.
If a tool is missing, is turned off in Keeploop, or answers that it needs Keeploop Pro, say so in one line and do what you can with the rest.
